# SMOKE: Simulink Model Obfuscation Keeping structurE

The SMOKE Tool removes, renames, and/or hides various aspects of a Simulink model in order to hide confidential information. This can be useful for eliminating proprietary details when sending models to third-parties, or even by removing details from models in order to create simpler images suitable for publication.
